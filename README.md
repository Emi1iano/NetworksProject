A song syncer for clone hero so people can download each others songs

#Intructions
In the server.py file change the songFolderPath to the location where your clone hero song directory is  
In the client.py change the serverName to your friends IP address and the songFolderPath to the same location as the previous step  
Start your server.py by running `python server.py`  
On another terminal run `python client.py` before you run this command make sure your friend has their server running  
Now on your client you should see all the songs your friend has that you don't  
Give the index of the song you want to request to download it from your friend
